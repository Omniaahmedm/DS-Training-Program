# Data Science Training Program: Project-Based Learning
**Instructor:** Omnia Elaeis  
**Role:** Data Science Instructor | Applied Machine Learning | Python & AI Trainer

---

## 🚀 Program Philosophy
This program is designed to bridge the gap between "coding" and "product building." We move beyond Jupyter Notebooks to teach students how to deploy models into real-world business environments.



## 🛠 Tech Stack & Industry Tools
* **Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NumPy), Scikit-Learn
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI
* **Deployment:** **FastAPI**, **Streamlit**, **Docker**
* **Advanced AI:** OpenCV (OCR), OpenAI/Hugging Face (RAG & LLMs)
* **Versioning:** Git & GitHub

## 📚 Curriculum Roadmap

### Phase 1: The Foundation (8 Weeks)
Focuses on data literacy, cleaning, and supervised machine learning.
* **Outcome:** Students can clean messy data and build predictive regression/classification models.
* **Core Skills:** EDA, Feature Engineering, Regression, and Classification.

### Phase 2: Advanced Project Track (5 Weeks)
Focuses on industry-specific "Applied AI" and deployment.
1. **Real Estate Prediction:** Regression + FastAPI Deployment.
2. **Fraud Detection:** Anomaly detection + Financial ROI analysis.
3. **Insurance OCR:** Computer Vision + Streamlit UI.
4. **Cyber Security:** Autoencoders for threat detection.
5. **Introduction to LLMs & Generative AI:** Building RAG-based assistants.
