# 🏠 Real Estate Price Prediction System – Case Study

## 1. Project Overview

The real estate market is highly dynamic, influenced by location, demand, property characteristics, and broader economic factors. Incorrect pricing can lead to lost opportunities, prolonged listing times, or financial losses.

This project focuses on building an **end-to-end intelligent system** that predicts real estate prices accurately and transparently, enabling better decision-making for investors, buyers, sellers, and real estate companies.

## 2. Business Problem

Real estate companies often face challenges such as:

* Inconsistent property pricing
* Heavy reliance on manual valuation and intuition
* Limited explainability behind pricing decisions

### Business Goal

To develop a **data-driven pricing system** that:

* Provides accurate property price predictions
* Explains key drivers behind each prediction
* Can be deployed and monitored in a real-world environment

---

## 3. Data & Sources

The system uses structured real estate data, including:

* Property listings (price, size, location, type)
* Historical transaction records

### Data Engineering Tasks

* Data ingestion from multiple sources
* Handling missing values and outliers
* Feature engineering (e.g., building age, neighborhood index)

---

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted to understand:

* Price distribution across neighborhoods
* Correlation between price and features such as area, age, and location
* Market patterns and anomalies

Key insights from EDA helped guide feature selection and model choice.

## 5. Modeling Approach

Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

* Random Forest Regressor
* XGBoost Regressor

### Evaluation Metrics

* RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
* R² Score

The final model was selected based on its ability to generalize well on unseen data.

---

## 6. Model Explainability (Business Intelligence)

To ensure transparency and trust:

* SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used
* Feature impact on individual predictions was analyzed

This step enables stakeholders to understand *why* a property receives a specific price estimate.

---

## 7. Deployment & MLOps

The trained model was prepared for production using:

* **FastAPI** for serving predictions via REST API
* **Streamlit** for an interactive dashboard

### Monitoring

* Model performance is tracked over time
* Market drift detection ensures predictions remain reliable as market conditions change

---

## 8. Business Impact

The proposed system enables:

* Faster and more accurate property valuation
* Reduced pricing errors and risk
* Data-driven strategic decisions for real estate businesses

---

## 9. Tech Stack

* Python, Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn, XGBoost
* SHAP
* FastAPI
* Streamlit
* Git & GitHub

---

## 10. Future Enhancements

* Automated retraining pipelines
* Integration with real-time listing platforms
* CI/CD for continuous deployment
